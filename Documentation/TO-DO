	Domoticz store the Domoticz Devices
	Zigate plugin store in an ASCI text file the plugin devices

		Load_DeviceList()
		Write_DeviceList()
		Remove_DeviceList()

	(2) Check
		Source of truth is Zigate HW
		DeviceExist(self, Addr)

0007 - Implement a DeleteDomoDevice() to delete a Device from Domoticz
	Use Device[Unit].Delete()

0008 - Implement Zigate Remove Device to delete a device from Zigate
	0x0026 command with Short Address (64bits) and Extended Address (64bits)
