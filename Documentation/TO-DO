0005 - Decode8015 Get List of Device ( response to 0015 )

0006 - We neeed to review the Device management and have a checking fonction for Database consitency
	Domoticz store the Domoticz Devices
	Zigate plugin store in an ASCI text file the plugin devices
	Zigate HW store the list of paired devices
	(1) For the Zigate DeviceList.txt we need to implement :
		Load_DeviceList()
		Write_DeviceList()
		Remove_DeviceList()

	(2) Check
		Source of truth is Zigate HW
		DeviceExist(self, Addr)
