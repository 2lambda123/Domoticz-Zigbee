0002 - Decode8701 à clarifier ... Que faire des Status

0006 - We neeed to review the Device management and have a checking fonction for Database consitency
	Domoticz store the Domoticz Devices
	Zigate plugin store in an ASCI text file the plugin devices
	Zigate HW store the list of paired devices
	(1) For the Zigate DeviceList.txt we need to implement :
		Load_DeviceList()
		Write_DeviceList()
		Remove_DeviceList()

	(2) Check
		Source of truth is Zigate HW
		DeviceExist(self, Addr)

0007 - Implement a DeleteDomoDevice() to delete a Device from Domoticz
	Use Device[Unit].Delete()

0008 - Implement Zigate Remove Device to delete a device from Zigate
	0x0026 command with Short Address (64bits) and Extended Address (64bits)

0009 - From Fred  Zigate developper, it looks that time to time devices might come with a new Short Address. In such case the reference must be the IEEE address

0010 - Zigate provides a SQN ... Shall and How to use/implement it in order to follow-up on commands send to Zigate.
	- SQN is per device 
	- We might enable a SQN field for each device, and detect out of range.
	- We might be able to track Command/Status, by implementing a a Pile where we store the command during the sendZigateCmd, and then when receive 8102, we can check that the command is successful. Otherwise, we can handle Error as well as Timeout

0011 - Final Review of Domo Creation and new device handling. Especially what and how to use properly RIA.

0012 - Thinking about restructuring the code. This is now more than 2000 Lines of code. It might be good to split in different files.
	We also need to agree on some fundamentals like:
		- where control are done
		- what do we allow and don't allow to do in MajDomoDevice
		- What do we allow and don't allow to do in Decodexxxx functions
		- What do we allow and don't allow to do in ReadCluster

0013 - Revue du code et protection de toutes les convertions type str -> int 
	Revue du code et protection des tests vis-à-vis variables non initialisée


0014 - Lors de l'exit du code / Lister le dictionnaire python


0015 - Update of Device[ID].Options['Zigate'] . Currently this is never updated as far as I understood. So it might be good to update .


0016 - Ajout de str(Ep) dans la création du device domoticz, comme nom par defaut ...
