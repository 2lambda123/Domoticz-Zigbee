Domoticz has a native hardware Class for managing the Xiaomi Gateway.

Investigations :
	As part of the Gateway it has the capabilities to manage/handle :
	- Xiaomi Cube
	- Aqara Cube
	
	as well as others Xiaomi devices
	
	
	For the Cube and Aqara Cube a Switch selector is created with the following Level Names
	- Xiaomi Cube : flip90/flip180/move/tap_twice/shake_air/swing/alert/free_fall
                	Off|flip90|flip180|move|tap_twice|shake_air|swing|alert|free_fall|clock_wise|anti_clock_wise
	
	- Aqara Cube :  flip90/flip180/move/tap_twice/shake_air/swing/alert/free_fall/rotate
                	Off|flip90|flip180|move|tap_twice|shake_air|swing|alert|free_fall|rotate"
	
	=> Xiaomi Cube doesn't have rotate, while Aqara Cube has clock wise and and anti clock wise 
	
	
	Looks like there is also a TextSensor  which is updated with the degrees of rotation, which is 90° or 180°
